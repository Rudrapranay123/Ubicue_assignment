Recommendations
Operational Improvements:

Focus on improving flight punctuality in countries/topics with high delays and cancellations. This might involve enhanced scheduling, maintenance, or resources allocation at problematic airports.

Analyze staff allocation and pilot schedules (pilot name data) to identify any operational bottlenecks causing delays.

Communication & Customer Experience:

Implement proactive passenger notification mechanisms for flights prone to delays or cancellations.

Develop contingency plans and support services for frequently disrupted routes.

Data Management:

Standardize airport and country naming conventions to avoid inconsistencies in reports.

Regularly review data quality to ensure accurate operational and strategic decisions.

Analytical Enhancements:

Leverage pivot tables to continuously monitor KPIs such as delay rates by route, country, and time period.

Use dashboards to visualize delay and cancellation trends for operational and executive decision-making.
